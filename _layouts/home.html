        	    <h3>Bio</h3>
                 I am a computational biologist with over seven years of experience in bioinformatics, data science, genomics, and molecular biology. Equally well-versed in academic research, I leverage a unique interdisciplinary background in neuroscience, immunology, and bioinformatics to create data-driven solutions that transform scientific results into clinical practices and targeted therapies. Currently, I am a postdoc at HZI, spearheading the development of multi-scale generative and inference models to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying viral, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative diseases.<br>
                 I received my PhD in neuroimmunology from MHH, working in Ulrich Kalinke's lab at Twincore. My doctoral research focused on deciphering the brain’s antiviral responses in virus-induced encephalitis. I developed novel experimental and computational tools for in-situ transcriptomics and investigated the brain cellular interactome following pathological insults. During my time there, I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team of immunologists (Luca Ghita, Andreas Pavlou, Veronica Duran, and Olivia Gern), neurologists (Lara Schröder and Thomas Skripuletz), and pharmaceutical experts (Martin Stangel) to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical translation.<br>
                 Beyond my technical skills, I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented individual with a strong work ethic and a collaborative spirit. I thrive in dynamic, interdisciplinary environments and continuously seek opportunities to learn and grow.<br>
